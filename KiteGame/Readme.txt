The goal of this game is to fly the kite as long as possible. The kite is flying in the wind, and the strength and direction of the wind changes at random between two set intervals. There is a constant gravity, pulling the kite towards the ground. This gravity, however, is occasionally counteracted with an upwards wind.

To move the kite, use the arrow keys and space-bar. The arrow keys will move the kite left, right, up and down, and the space-bar "yanks" the kite towards a fixed point at the top of the ground. The longer you hold in the space-bar, the stronger the yank will be. Tap the space bar for a small yank, or hold it in for up to 3 seconds for a stronger yank. The strength of the yank does, however, max out after 3 seconds, and holding the space bar in longer will produce no extra force.

If your kite touches the ground or "flies away" (i.e. touches the sides or top of the screen) you lose. Reload the screen to try again.

Good luck and happy kite flying!
